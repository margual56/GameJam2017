# GameJam2017
Game developed in 5 days for the Game Jam of June 2017.

## Enviroment
This project was made using Unreal Engine version 4.21 and transferred into Unreal Engine version 4.25 (so to open it, use version 4.25).<br/>
It is not built because the executable was more than 100MB. Use Unreal Engine.

## Game Jam
The theme was "Blessing in desguise".<br/>
We ended up in the 80th position because of a bug that turned the screen black after entering into the wooden house, so it was unplayable beyond that point.

## Authors
<ins>Robert Martínez Lewis</ins> is the voice of the main character and the ghosts. He did the 3D models and some of the programming.<br/>
I (<ins>Marcos Gutiérrez Alonso</ins>) did the programming, including the AI and the game mechanics.
